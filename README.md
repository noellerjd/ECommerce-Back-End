# E-Commerce Back End

## Description

My motivation behind this project was to create a clean backend to handle an E-Commerce back end.

- I built this project to become more familiar with get, post, delete, and put requests.

- The problem this project is looking to solve is to create easy ways to add, edit and remove items from a database using the get, post, delete, and put requests.

I learned a lot about structuring the models and utilizing those models win each request to create a uniform structure of the database. I also learned a lot about structuring each type of request.
